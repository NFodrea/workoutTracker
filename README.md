# Workout Tracker
This was a project I made to get used to Ionic 2 with Angular. It is a CRUD application for tracking workout lifts. I used firebase as a backend with email and password authentication for login and signup. 

AngularFire2 was used for the interactions with Firebase. Workout tracker uses observables to sync data and update in realtime.
